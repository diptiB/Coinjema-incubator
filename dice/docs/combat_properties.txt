Properties of this system:

1. A fighter's choice of skills, armor, and weapon form determines their role in combat.  When fighting in groups, a group made up of fighters playing different roles beats groups of fighters all playing the same role
2. Regardless of the "level" of the warriors on boths sides, length of combat remains about the same.  Ie, two first level fighters get to have as epic a battle as two 20th level fighters.
3. It's impossible to be taken out by one hit.  Unlikely to be taken out by two.
4. No hit points - a player leaves combat when "taken out", the meaning of which is flexible except that they are no longer involved in the immediate combat
5. Shields matter.  sword and shield will defeat a two-handed weapon most of the time.
6. Armor matters.  The difference between getting hit with a longsword while wearing armor and not wearing armor is immense.
7. A group of fighters without teamwork will get destroyed by a group of fighters that are trained to fight together.
